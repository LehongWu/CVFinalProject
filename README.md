# PKU 2023 Computer Vision Final Project - MaskGIT

## Code Files & Folders 
main.py: run the code  
engine_train/test.py: contain the training/testing function  
model: network architectures  
utils: tools (visualize/metrics/...)  
feeder: dataloader  
maskgit_reference_code: code framework provided by teacher(useless)  

## Other Files & Folders
will be created manually or by running the code  

exp: tensorboard outputs  
ckpt: checkpoints  
visualize: visualization(testing) results  

## Assets
Assets folder provides pre-trained checkpoints, using Git LFS (while ckpt folder is generated when running the code, they are different)

Step1 Install Git LFS (follow online tutorials).  
Step2 When pulling, large files will not be pulled. If you want to pull large files, run "git lfs pull".
